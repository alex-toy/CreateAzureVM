How to quickly deploy a VM using a powershell script ?

1. run *C:\source\create-vm-starter\commands\deploy_app.ps1*. All the resources will automatically be deployed on Azure. 

2. Then execute instructions contained in *commands\VirtualMachine\VM_deploy.txt*. Just think of coding your application and enjoy seeing it working on the web! ;-)

3. Once you're done, make sure to run *commands\delete_resources.ps1* in order to delete all the resources!!!

In case you want to deploy the app locally, you need to activate your virtual environment : *.\venv\Scripts\activate*

Do not hesitate to contact me if you want more info on that. ;-)
